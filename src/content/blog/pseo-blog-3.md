=======================================================
Hi! I just launched a SaaS product @ [10MinuteCMO.com](http://10minutecmo.com). This is part 3 of my PSEO bloggin series. Here is [part 1](https://billyjameshowell.com/blog/pseo-blog-1) and [part 2](https://billyjameshowell.com/blog/pseo-blog-2)

The Tagline: Crush SEO by building up content targeting low volume keywords everyday in just 10 minutes.
========================================================================================================

Background
==========

After working in SEO content for about a year I came across this idea called Programmatic SEO (PSEO).

PSEO is the concept of using existing data or knowledge to generate hundreds of landing pages and blog posts for your business. By going after lots of low volume keywords you can dominate your niche.

Now, I knew that you could spam Google with low quality, AI-generated content. But it had never occurred to me that with programming and a little bit of human review each day you could take existing data and make it into a content factory.

So I immediately [made an MVP](https://medium.com/@billy-howell/i-learned-programmatic-seo-pseo-in-one-day-f397be9182e3) called [VSTdatabase.com](http://vstdatabase.com). This database is made up of info about music production plugins. The system then makes [blog posts](https://www.vstdatabase.com/blog) based on the database items.

After a week, organic search traffic started trickling in. From there I [refined my system](https://medium.com/@billy-howell/airtable-make-com-for-programmatic-seo-75d6fe26dd88) and launched a [second demo site](https://www.pickleballerblog.com/).

Two weeks later I’ve got a functional website and app thanks to [Softr.io](http://softr.io), [Airtable](http://airtable.com) and [Midjourney](http://midjourney.com). Clients can login and use my system all in one convenient dashboard.

What does 10MinuteCMO do?
=========================

The app prompts you with 3 content ideas each day that you can review or edit. Then AI creates content using those ideas, which you then approve or edit again. Finally, you can schedule the content on your calendar to go live on the channels of your choice.

Of course, you can ratchet the number of daily pieces generated up or down. The idea is that you can quality control your brand voice by reviewing three pieces of content each day. If you want to spray and pray we can post 100 blogs and check analytics after a month.

What content can 10MinuteCMO create?
====================================

*   **Blog content** structured for SEO dominance. Can be exported as markdown, html, json or integrated with you front end website host
*   **Social content** automatically posted after your review or stashed in an Airtable or Google sheets database
*   **Landing pages** also structured for SEO dominance and exported in markdown, html, json or integrated with you front end

What do I have to do?
=====================

It’s no fun setting up database tables and automations and API keys so we do that part for you. All you need to do is spend 10 minutes a day looking at content and asking “Is this up to our quality standards?” and “Does this fit our brand voice?”
