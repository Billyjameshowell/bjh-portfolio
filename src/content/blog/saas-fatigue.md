Introduction
Brief on SaaS
Introducing the concept of 'SaaS Fatigue'

I am coining the term "SaaS Fatigue". It's official, there's too much software. 

I run a small marketing agency called Owex Labs. I've consulted with startups on SEO, blockchain tech and business automations.

Every business has different software needs. But it takes too damn long to find the solutions. 

It feels like you have to do hours of "pre-work" before you can get to the real work. 

The problem is two-fold
1. There's TOO MUCH software to choose from
2. The scope of each solution is too small

Most founders shouldn't be burning hours determining which no-code platform integrates best with Google sheets. 

Which automation software will let them combine PDFs the best.

I know what you're thinking.

"Learn to code."

I did! Frankly, I should probably code my own solutions more often.  

This isn't a "software is too expensive" rant. There's just something smothering about building a business that's reliant on SaaS. 

What's the solution? 

Maybe it's to code everything yourself. Or maybe it's to be more systematic with your approach to system design.
